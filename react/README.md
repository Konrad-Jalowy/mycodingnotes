## How to start react project
You should probably use vite but for demo projects you can get away with
```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```
And if you need react in current directory you use command
```sh
npx create-react-app .
```
Its good to create local projects, like one has backend in node, another has frontned in react. You create client directory and then use above command there.
