# php mvc
Ive done some php mvc project. I just want to make some notes here. and there are a lot to note. Ive done that projects long time ago, now i want to refresh my memory, organize it and so on

## Folders
- **basic-helpers** - things that help to start some dummy project (like without even composer) such as autoloading, redirects, simple templating, inspecting, well helpers you use when you just open up directory in xampp htdocs just to try out things
