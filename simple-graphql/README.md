How to setup and make basic tasks using graphql simple tutorial/reminder

## What graphql is
Its not a database (in our example we use in-memory storage). Its rather alternative to rest api. One endpoint, one method (usually POST) and one query language common to all apis using graphql. One thing you must learn using api is what are the types and what are their fields. Thats not a lot compared to learning all the endpoints and typical things that come with rest api.
